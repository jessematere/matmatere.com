            <h2>PHOTO GALLERY</h2>
            <p>
                In this gallery section, they are photos that I took while in campus during my free time projects.They are from outdoor photography and not indoor(studio photography).
                I had a friend who had a cannon camera that I would take and do my personal work with it. The following are just  samples that I have selected and are mostly for colleagues, keeping in mind that others would complain of infringing their rights due issues of consent so I decided to use those of my friends who would be okay with what I have done.
            </p>

            <figcaption>The photos  presented above are raw except one; the guy with a pullneck that was taken during a harsh weather the sun light was too severe(1pm) and it affected the higlights.I edited it to knock down the highlights so that the exposure would be correct.  Others may argue that I could have used the camera settings dwelling on the pricinple guiding photography(ISO, shutter speed and aparture) to solve the issue of lighting. This was unachievable because  the ISO was on its lowest value the remaing option would have been to go with the lowest shutter speed in TV mode but in turn it would affected exposure and also the shadows. So I had to make it have more highlights then reduce it in post production.</figcaption>

                <summary>OVERVIEW ON PHOTOGRAPHY</summary>
                <p>Photography is a diverse area that one would like to venture. The avenues includes photo-journalism, studio photography, landscape photography or even bieng a paparazzi. Some people learn the art of photography from others while some will go to school to aquire the general knowledge. There is this cliche that whenever I take a camera it guide me on what is required; "greate photos are made not taken". This is actually true because your judgement on the composition in your frame is what will tell the type of results you will achieve. For the basic  knowledge, the guiding principle  are three features that will determine. they include;ISO, aparture, and the shutterspeed . These are the ones that will tell the nature of your work and the type of a photo you will  have since different photos will tell different story depending on your composition. With the advancement of technology we have seen mirrorless  cameras  replacing the modern DSLR  that are current in the market. Also the issue of focusing, campanies have advanced where by the settings are made simple like focusing point and also eye ditactor for enhancing focusing technique. This modernization are revolutionalizing photography where these techniques are being simplified. </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, majority of my photos  above have the bokeh effect and are either close up or medium shots. That is my nature when it comes to portrait shots because the shallow depth field of view communicates your skills in managing both the foreground and the background in my frame composition. This isn't the case when it come to landsacpe photography because with the kind of shot nature always has some additional story to tell about the main subject. For example a shot of a lion in the park, it should have a wide depth field of view because the sorroundings tells additional information about the main subject, like if it is  dry or shrubs like environment, it means the drought is hitting hard, this should raise concern.</p>

During  my attachement period at Kenya News Agency Malindi I was lucky to work with various correspondents reporters from various media station(Citizen tv and radio, KBC, nation media group, standard media group,  k24 tv, the Star, lulu fm radio and sauti ya pwani radio) who have really mentored me all through in my career life. </p>

    <br><figcaption>This project was just a trial work to try and utilize the skills in designing. Since I'm a communication and public relation practitioner, I have knowledge on marketing, branding and advertising. Sometimes a product brand may hit its peak level then it becames stagnant in the market  or maybe face competition. In such cases, it needs some marketing strategy to be repositioned in the market. That is why I created this design to try and make my  imaginary product "mountain view mineral water" to have a competitive advantage over other products. The project has various photos(the two models, the clouds,the ocean, the glass and the water bottle) from pixabay and unsplash.com then I manipilated them in photoshop  to create the poster before putting it on  the billboard mockup  stand that I downloaded from free mockups.com</figcaption>

    POSTER DESCRIPTION
    </summary>
    <p>All the posters I created using photoshop a product that can be accessed from adobe clouds. I prefer using photoshop since its interface is user friendly and one can get along with it well. It has features that help one to manipulate a photo to meet the design intended to achieve.Some would use illustrator but for me I think that is just trials to make ends meet. Photoshop would serve you well  in such design.</p>

    <h2>MOTION GRAPHICS PROJECTS AND VIDEOS</h2>
    <p>This section is mainly for videos and  graphics designs. Some of the videos were projects for clients while some were just for exposure to build a portifolio through creativity.</p>
    <h3>STORYBOARDING </h3>
    <p>My motivation to do such videos was just to widen my scope of coming up with  ideas then  generate a short message to complete my project. As you may see and noticed that  some of the work I have done I have mentioned  companies that exist. I would like to state that <strong> THIS HAS NOTHING  WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE COMPANIES AND THE BRANDS MENTIONED BUT JUST MY CREATIVITY TRIAL WORK.</strong> Don't mistake my work for that of the companies'. It is  portfolio work.</p>
        <figure>
          <video src="videos/uv mapping for trial.mp4" controls></video> 
          <title>Uv mapping    and design  </title> 
          <figcaption> I did this short video to showcase my diverse ability in designing. The work itself began in blender where i designed the box . I decided to do the packaging design having seen an ad on one  of the media station where there was a milk advert. The essence of the video is to show the skill I have in package design and also the wrapping of the 3d model in blender. Blender is a powerful software  in the sence that one can do diverse project with it. I personally uses it for modeling since the animation setup in its interface utilizes the use of png render first then compaling them later to video and that needs a powerfull machine not a windows pc like mine.</figcaption>
         </figure>
        <figure>
          <video src="videos/FESTIVE SEASONS.mp4" controls></video> 
          <title>Mapishi  </title> 
          <figcaption> Having noticed that we are approaching the festive season, this short advert  is to promote my imaginary supermarket and also encourage our loyal customer to shop with us  by reducing the price. I have also studied advertisement so i monitor the trend and market my shop to position it at a favourable competing environment. The whole project is the product of blender where I designeg the lamp, the table the three and also the baloon. There is also  photoshop used to create the  the png images for the products on offer. Then audition for my voicing Lastly after effects using element 3d plugin since blender is powerful and my machine cannot work properly when using it for animation.</figcaption>
         </figure>
        <figure>
          <video src="videos/MAPISHI_halisi.mp4" controls></video> 
          <title>Mapishi  </title> 
          <figcaption> Mapishi halisi video was made through  a combination of various software. They include; illustrator where upon dowloading the vectors file, I had to separate layers that I will later animate, then after effects where i used duik bissel tool, a plugin that helps you rig and animate, there is also adobe audition where I did the voice over then transfered both the video and audio to premier pro since my machine has a small ram and couldn't be of use to add the audio to the video direct.</figcaption>
         </figure>


        <figure>
          <video src="videos/kenya_na uhalisia.mp4" controls></video> 
          <title>uhalisia na uhuru wetu</title>
          <figcaption>The elections results and the outcome that people  will have to live by what was declared, transpired me to do  this small sensitization video to encourage people to be positive about the results and be patriotic . I used illustrator to draw the map then element 3d plugin in after effects to make it 3d  and the animation then added the voiceover.</figcaption>
         </figure>

        <figure>
          <video src="videos/feature teaser.mp4" controls></video>
          <title>Teaser for a featere story</title> 
          <figcaption>The video above was a project for a friend who is an investigative reporter. He wanted a teaser that will help him introduce the story to the people. I used the still photographs that portrays what has been going on and people will be able to know what the story is all about easily. I also used glitch effect and analog signals to try and paint the picture of how the insecurity disrupts the normal daily routines of the people who are victims.</figcaption>
         </figure>

      
        <figure>
          <video src="videos/PHONE AD.mp4" controls></video> 
          <title>Fon branding</title>
          <figcaption>I spent most of my time online to see  how projects are made(pintrest)  It includes various adverts. I saw how new products are hyped to penetrate the market and that inspired me to do this video to brand  the sumsung phone. I chose to use samsung brand because it is growing fast to give competition to apple company and try to bridge the gap of users of luxurious brands and cannot afford apple products. NB. The ad has nothing to do with sumsung company or product. Even the fon brand may or may not exist in the market. </figcaption>
         </figure>

      
        <figure>
          <video src="videos/MAT TV.mp4" controls width="640"></video> <title>Mchipuko wa MAT TV new intro</title>
       <figcaption> After going through the interface of element 3D plugin well, I did this project to test my understanding. The name of the tv channel is imaginary and out of creativity. News intro are used to alert the viewers that new is about to commence. To achieve the motive of the news intro one has to look for a music for background that has a tone showing that this an introduction to what is about to go down. It is one of the projcet that motivates me to do 3d stuff since I found it interesting just like the 2d stuff only that 3d tries to make things to be  real like in the real life situation.</figcaption>

                <summary>VIDEO & MOTION GRAPHICS SUMMARY</summary>
                <p>There are softwares that enables a person to come up with such projects. They include; adobe premier pro that is generally known for editing videos, after effects,  as the name suggest is for adding effects to your project. This has been of great help to my work since it supports plugins that makes work easy(duik, motion bro, element 3d, saber, lense flares, skin retouch etc). Adobe audition mainly work was for editing the audio. Then there is photoshop where still photographs can be edited and the used for video cut.  Lastly is blender which is a powerful one when it comes to 3d since it has many fuction like modeling storyboarding, sculpting, shading, lighting, rendering etc, it is diverse. Having knowledge about the mentioned above makes it easy for designers and editors to traverse across all the applications that are of their choice to deliver.</p>

<h2>MAGAZINES SAMPLES PRACTISE</h2>
<p>This section is basically for project that I have done using adobe indesign. To be able to get  elegant  result in such designs, one needs to incorporate skills of three softwares; photoshop fo editing and manipulating your photos to be used, there is also illustrator that will serve you a greater deal when working on a project that will make the use of vector  illustrations like programming magazines where it doubles the understanding of the content in the publication. Lastly is the adobe indesign where it does not limit you on pages unlike photoshop nad adobe illustrator.  Having skills in all  will help you to come up with designs that are superb.</p>

It was to be simple keeping in mind the company color theme  so that it comes out to be official and directly relates to the business itself.

<figcaption>This was a project to make a design for the business profile. Most of the work had be done by photoshop mine was to improvise and modify the design using adobe indesign so that it matches  and fits the client perspective on the final product and how it should come out. With  new media  phasing out  traditional media, many clients prefer their work to be in softcopy form so that they can share through social media handles and also upload on their websites so that whenever a client visit that site thay can see the profile there.</figcaption>

<p>This magazine focuses on ventures that people  partake to make a living, it can be either a talent or skills aquired through training. The magazine was just for trial, you will notice that the content in the body section does not go in hand with the photos used. The content I used, I took from my research project . The general idea was to implement the fundamental principles of design(like  the general layout; typography, master header, kickers, pug and puffs, pull quotes, round track, secondary coverage, captions, colors etc). I designed the magazine just to see how all element will be used to arrive at the design.</p>

<p>The design is just for practise to  gauge skill aquired in school because I had a unit that required one to either do stories on mainstream dailies, do corperate documentaries or do magazine designs and I chose to do magazine since the skill I had aquired was enough to do  designing. The magazine generally focuses on the principles of designing.</p>

<p>The calender is my latest design. Knowing how powerful adobe indesign is, you can do a lot of stuffs with it like the design above. I used calender wizard that I downloaded as as an extension then installed in the software that helps to generate  calender dates, months automatically . Mine was just to editing the design and make sure holidays are marked and use photos that will be appealing to the peeople who would want to have the calender.</p>
